/*
life-logging: A Rust-based continuous audio recording service

Project Plan:
1. Implement a ring buffer for efficient audio data management
   - Use HeapRb from the ringbuf crate for heap-allocated storage
   - Utilize SPSC (Single Producer, Single Consumer) for concurrent access

2. Develop audio capture functionality
   - Use the cpal crate for cross-platform audio input
   - Implement a separate thread for continuous audio capture

3. Create a local server interface
   - Use the rocket crate to provide a web-based control interface
   - Allow starting and stopping the recording service

4. Implement audio data management
   - Maintain a rolling buffer of the last 300 seconds of audio
   - Minimize memory usage and system resource consumption

5. Add configuration options
   - Allow customization of buffer duration, sample rate, etc.
